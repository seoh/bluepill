Blue PiLL
---

I'm Hakell and Elm newbie. I was finding tutorials for Haskell and Elm,
and I had happy weekend with Goran Milovanovic's kind [Elm Tutorial
](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtdCJGSpculbDT_p4ED9oLTJQrzoM1QEL) and
[Source](https://github.com/GoranM/bluepill).  But it is a little bit outdated.
I found [another project](https://github.com/tmmcguire/bluepill)
of BluePiLL based on Elm of later verion, but it was also outdated. Then, I try
to follow videos with writing codes in step by step(based-on Elm 0.15.1).
As wrote I am newbie. Welcome to PR for answering questions in comments or
improving styleguide or fixing logical error or something what can help me or
other newbies. Thanks!


### Try

``` sh
$ git clone git@github.com:seoh/bluepill.git
$ cd bluepill
$ elm-package install
$ elm-reactor
```

and open http://localhost:8000

### Make index.html

``` sh
$ elm-make Main.elm --output index.html
```

or which elm you want to see.
